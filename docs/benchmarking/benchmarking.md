Progress of the community in reduction of time to solution and energy consumption for the PD14 model. Colors group
hardware architectures and shapes indicate algorithmic approach (legend). Abbreviations in panels further disambiguate 
individual studies. (a) Ratio between time passed on wall-clock and stretch of time covered by the model (real-time factor) versus the
year of publication in semi logarithmic representation. (b) Real-time factor as a function of energy per synaptic event in double
logarithmic representation. Dashed line from fit through all data points with a slope of one. (c) Real-time factor versus process
node in double logarithmic representation. Dashed line from fit through CPU and GPU data points with a slope of two. Citations
of studies and values are given [here](figures/performance_summary.md). Figure from [(Senk et al., 2026)][1].
